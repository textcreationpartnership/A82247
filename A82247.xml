         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore we do at once both deſire and truſt that our Brethren, will be as confident as ever Brethren were of Brethren, that by the grace and aſſiſtance of Jeſvs Chriſt come what may come no alteration of affairs whatſoever ſhall ever remove us from thoſe principles and intentions, which have beene profeſsed before God and all the world, in our ſolemn Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and in our publicke Declarations from time to time We ſhould think it a greater ſinne in us then in others and ſhould certainly expect a greater curſe and examplary judgement from the righteous God, if ever there ſhall be cauſe to ſay that the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> remembred not the brotherly Covenant. We owe indeed all loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and lawfull obedience to the King. Neither ſhall our prayers and beſt endeavours be wanting for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and defence of his Royall perſon and authority in the preſervation and defence of the true Religion and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Kingdomes: but God forbid that we ſhould ever ſeperate or connive at any who would ſeperate what the covenant linketh together, tht glory of God and good of Religion being alwayes the principall, and Gods intereſt more then Caeſars, although not excluſive of Caeſars.</p>
            <p>And now deare Brethren, although we are confident of you through the Lord, that you neither are nor will be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161425:3"/>otherwiſe minded then to ſtand faſt in the truth of Chriſt and to be faithfull to the death in the Covenant you have taken: yet give us leave to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance, That whereto you and we have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there may be a walking by the ſame rule, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>The Directory of worſhip being aboot two yeares agoe agreed upon by the Aſsemblies and parliament of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>The Doctrinall part of Church-Government agreed upon by the reverend and learned Aſsembly of Divines was at the ſame time with the Directory of worſhip approved by the generall Aſsembly as ſound and orthodoxe for the matter, and agreed unto on their part, that it be a part of the uniformity and a Confeſſion of Faith for the Churches of Chriſt in the three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Wee wiſh and hope that you all may ſtand, faſt and firme together in the ſame principles and rules, and that theſe reſults of ſo long learned Syndiocall debates may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally find acceptance through the Kingdome? It cannot be expected that ſuch a Reformation as is according to the mind of Chriſt and tendeth to the caſting out of <hi>Satans</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to the cenſuring of prophaneſs, and ſuppreſſing of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſie can be carried on without a mighty and ſtrong oppoſition: But how ſtrong ſoever the oppoſition be it is but the ſtrength of <hi>Satanne</hi> and wicked men: the weapons of your warre farre (if well handled) are more ſtrong, and mighty through God to the caſting downe of every thing that exhalteth it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> againſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt: The eyes of God, Angells, and Man, are now in a more ſpeciall manner upon you obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to acquit your ſelves in this time of triall-</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:161425:4"/>
            <p> We know your temptations are many &amp; great, yet ſuch as God hath in his Word fore-warned you of, promiſing withall, that with your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he will make a way to eſcape that ye may be able to bear it, faithfull is he who hath called you who alſo will do it. When you are preſſed out of meaſure and above ſtrength, it is that you ſhould not truſt to your ſelves but to God; So that when you are weak, then are you ſtrong, and when the adverſaries of truth are ſtrong, then are they weak, Be it therefore farre from you to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome with the tentations either on the right hand by complyance, and doing good that evill may come of it, or on the left by a deſpendency of ſpirit, and caſting away of your confidence, which as we truſt you will not. It is indeed the amazement of the Chriſtian World, that after ſuch a ſolemn Covenant for hereſie and ſchiſme, theſe pernicious plants have bin ſuffered to ſpred more then ever before. Tis a ſtupendious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, that a little horne ſhould grow forth and wax great, and have an hoſt given it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the dayly ſacrifice by reaſon of tranſgreſſion yea to caſt down the truth to the ground, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and proſpering, and even by peace deſtroying many. Such things God hath permitted long ago, yet but for a time, having prelimited a certain
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161425:4"/>period thereunto: truth was at laſt victorious, and ſo ſhall be, in the mean time the greater and more horrid the preſent evils be, tis the more neceſſary for you, and you have the cleerer call from God to give teſtimony againſt them, and the greater were the ſin and danger, if you ſhould not. But we are the more confident, that you ſhall not fall under this ſin and danger, becauſe you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by your Sermons and Writings ſo much wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed for the truth, and againſt the errours of theſe times. God can as eaſily drive all the monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errours and hereſies out of <hi>England,</hi> as once he took away all the locuſts out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by a mighty ſtrong W<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt wind, ſo that there remained not one locuſt in all the Coaſts of <hi>Egypt.</hi> God can make the earth to open her mouth, and ſwallow up the floud which the Dragon caſt our of his mouth: it is not in vain in the worſt of times to be witneſſes for Chriſt and for his truth, to do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and truſt God with events.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for our part you are in our heares to live and dye with you, and we ceaſe not to make mention of you in our prayers dayly: believing alſo that God hath thoughts of peace towards you and not of evill, to give you an expected end; and that when he hath humbled his people under his mighty hand, and brought them to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161425:5"/>an acknowledgment of thoſe offences which are the true cauſes of his controverſie, he will awake for their help and appear for their joy. And then they who are by a temporary ſucceſse hardned in wayes of Errour or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancie, ſhall ſee it, and be aſhamed, and ſhall wonder and periſh, but peace ſhall be upon <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
